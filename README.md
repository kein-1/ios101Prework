- File sharing and integrations with various productivity tools

Spotify:

- Vast music library with millions of songs
- Personalized playlists and recommendations
- Offline listening and cross-device syncing

Notion:
- Numerous templates to suit the user's needs
- Easy to change between templates, note types, and note formats
- Drag-and-drop features make the app very smooth 

2. App / App idea I want to build:
    - Dog Dating/Friend Matching app
    
Similar to a dating app, except this is for dogs. Users can upload photos of their dogs and see local dogs nearby. If there is a match, users can message each other to setup   playdates with other dogs. Some basic features will consist of users registering their dog(s) onto the app. They would be required to fill in information such as breed, age, and interests. Users will also be required to provide copies of vaccine status so dogs are safe. On the main app page, users will be able to see the profiles of dogs around the area along with the dog's personal information and intersts, and choose either to "like" or "reject" the featured page. Lastly, users should also be able to see who chose to "like" their profile.
